# Changelog

All notable changes to Peaky are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] — report refactor

### Changed (BREAKING — output schema)
- **Report tier `Identified` renamed to `Assigned`.** The top assignment tier is now
  labelled **Assigned** everywhere it surfaces: the `tier` column values in
  `merged_ledger.csv` (and every per-file ledger), the workbook **Assigned** sheet
  (was "Identified"), the PDF report tier counts/labels, the GKA-widget legend, and
  the Summary "Tiers" rows. **This is a schema break**: downstream consumers that
  filter on `tier == "Identified"` must switch to `tier == "Assigned"`. The
  `Candidate` and below-assignability tiers are unchanged.
- The Summary M0 role label is now **"M0 (has formula)"** (was "assigned (M0)") to
  avoid colliding with the renamed tier; the role word "assigned" is otherwise
  unchanged.

### Added (plausibility hardening — Stage 3, demote-only)
- **One shared plausibility oracle** (`peaky/plausibility.py`): `is_oxygen_monster`
  (`O/C > 1.3`) and `is_carbon_cluster` (`DBE/C >= 1.0`, F-free, C≥2, half-integer-DBE
  radicals EXEMPT) now back BOTH the scrutiny `implausible()`/`scan()` flags and the
  new tier demotes, so a flagged formula and a demoted formula can never disagree. The
  carbon-cluster cutoff is `DBE/C >= 1.0` (NOT the earlier 0.75 proposal, which wrongly
  caught real aromatics — pyridine/coumarin/umbelliferone/furfural/phthalic anhydride
  all sit below 1.0 and are spared).
- **Per-file demotes** (`demote_oxygen_monsters`, `demote_carbon_clusters`, wired into
  `assign.run` after tiering): an oxygen-lattice monster (`O/C > 1.3` AND degeneracy
  mass-saturated — *not* niso-gated, since a ¹³C confirms carbon count, not the O count)
  or a carbon cluster is demoted Assigned→Candidate + `below_assignability`. Never
  deletes a row.
- **New artifact `tables/plausibility_audit_<tag>.csv`** — one row per touched peak
  (`mz, neutral_formula, before_tier, after_tier_or_role, reason, evidence, degeneracy_note,
  n_iso`); always written (header-only when nothing was touched) so the artifact set is
  stable.

### Deferred
- **In-source fragment auto-detection.** A batch-level heuristic that relabelled an
  adduct-less protonated M0 as an `in-source fragment` of a heavier co-varying parent
  (full adduct-ratio + facile-loss + time-series triangulation), plus a companion
  series-coherence check that dissolved time-incoherent homolog ladders, was prototyped
  and **removed before release**: on real merged multi-sample data the triangulation
  over-fired (co-incidental facile-loss mass matches between unrelated co-varying
  analytes), so the `role=fragment` label, the report "Fragment ions" sheet, the grey
  Van Krevelen fragment marker, and the `ledger.mark_fragment` API were dropped. The
  retained O-monster + carbon-cluster demotes and the `plausibility_audit` CSV are
  unaffected. Fragment detection may return once a more discriminating gate is found.

## [Unreleased] — 0.5.0 (reference peaklists + chemical-plausibility hardening)

Adds a context-gated literature/contaminant peaklist layer and closes a set of
chemical-plausibility gaps surfaced by manual review and a cross-pipeline
(Orbitool) comparison — the pipeline now assigns by mass **and** checks that the
isotope evidence + ionization chemistry actually support each Assigned formula.

### Added
- **Reference peaklists** (`peaky/reflists.py` + `peaky/data/peaklists/`): a curated,
  self-describing catalog (metadata + version + references + provenance) of known
  molecules per chemical system — seeded with α-pinene OH-oxidation HOM (Kang, FZJ
  E&U 557; 830 neutrals) and the Keller 2008 MS contaminant list (59 neutrals).
  Used three ways, all soft + provenance-tagged (never overrides an isotope-scored
  Assigned): (1) **selection prior** — a candidate on an active list wins a near-tie
  in arbitration; (2) **rescue-verify** — unexplained peaks matched by mass are scored
  with the server and committed if confirmed (or kept as a tentative low-quality
  Candidate when too dim to confirm); (3) **report** corroboration/rescue section
  + `tables/reflist_matches_*.csv`. Lists are context-gated by run metadata
  (contaminants always active).
- `docs/ASSIGNMENT_DETAIL.md` — exhaustive per-pass / per-gate pipeline reference.

### Changed (chemical-plausibility hardening)
- **Reagent-halocarbon relabel** — bromomethane reagent fragments mis-read as a bare
  element + reagent-cluster (e.g. CHBr₂⁻ as "C" via `[M+HBr+Br]-`) are reclassified
  on the invariant ion composition (CH₂Br₂→reagent, dibromoacetic acid→named).
- **Confirmed-isotope F-demote exemption** — a high-F formula is exempted only when a
  Cl/Br/S anchor's diagnostic isotope (³⁴S/³⁷Cl/⁸¹Br) is *confirmed*, not merely in
  the formula (a reagent-Br adduct's ⁸¹Br does not count).
- **Si-count intensity gate** (siloxane ladder **and** pass-0 silanediol) — a Si-rich
  commit requires its ²⁹Si M+1 to *match* the Si count, not just be matched; stops a
  high-O HOM (e.g. C₁₀H₁₈O₁₁) being claimed as a siloxane on a too-weak envelope.
- **New tier demotes** (post-tiering, never deletes): carbon-cluster (F-free H/C<0.35),
  implausible-ionization (heteroatom-free hydrocarbon via an anion channel that needs
  an acidic/H-bond site), and speculative-residual (residual:* commits resting on
  off-cal z, uncorroborated multi-N, 0-anchor series, or a sole minor channel).
- **Scrutiny page** — F-flag wording corrected (¹⁹F is monoisotopic — the F *count* is
  unconfirmable; any ¹³C/⁸¹Br satellites confirm only carbon/the adduct), per-row
  evidence (score · ppm · isotopes · sane-alternative), and pagination.

### Fixed
- Report cover now states the **actual** sample-selection method (single-sample /
  brightest-coverage / representative) and a peak census (total / assigned /
  unexplained) from the ledger; reference-list section paginated (no clipping);
  single-sample reports include the Van Krevelen figure.

## [Unreleased] — 0.4.0 (public-release refactor)

A refactor pass preparing Peaky for the public `karsa-oy/peaky` repo: cleaner
install, content-stable reproducibility, organized outputs, a brightest-coverage
batch mode, and a full design-doc set.

### Added
- **`peaky setup`** — one-command workspace bootstrap: creates `.env` from the
  template, points outputs at the workspace's `output/` folder (`PEAKY_OUTPUT_DIR`),
  creates it, verifies the install (+ the Mascope connection if creds are set), and
  prints the layout + next steps. Re-runnable. Makes "clone → install → know what to
  do" a two-command path. Batch `--out-dir` now defaults to `$PEAKY_OUTPUT_DIR` (the
  workspace `output/`) else `~/peaky-output`.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — the canonical design doc (ledger model, pass sequence,
  end-to-end data flow with diagram, reproducibility model, module map).
  Companion docs `docs/ASSIGNMENT.md` (what assignment produces, for a scientist)
  and `docs/OUTPUTS.md` (every artifact, where + what).
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- **Brightest-coverage batch selection** (`--select brightest`, the "bin-then-assign"
  mode). Bins all batch peaks by m/z and assigns each significant bin's *brightest*
  sample (greedy set-cover, `--coverage-target`/`--k-max`/`--height-floor`). Better
  analyte coverage than the time-grid+max-TIC default (which a reagent-CIMS run's
  reagent ion dominates); feeds the same assign → merge → report chain, so outputs
  are unchanged. A coverage play, not a speed play. (`sampling.select_brightest_coverage_samples`.)
- Legacy workspace-based Mascope server support (`io_mascope`): connects to older
  deployments where `/api/datasets` 404s, resolving workspaces/batches via the raw
  endpoints. Additive and gated — modern servers are unaffected.

### Changed
- **Import package renamed `mascope_assign` → `peaky`.** A `mascope_assign`
  back-compat shim aliases the old import path — including submodules — to the same
  `peaky` objects, so existing `import mascope_assign` code keeps working unchanged.
  Version bumped to 0.4.0.
- **PyPI distribution name is `mascope-peaky`** (`peaky` was already registered).
  The import package and the `peaky` CLI are unchanged — `pip install mascope-peaky`
  then `import peaky` / run `peaky` (dist ≠ import, like scikit-learn/sklearn).
- **Single canonical lockfile.** Removed the hand-maintained `requirements.txt`
  (which had drifted from the real pins); `uv.lock` is now the only pinned source.
  `pip install -e .` uses the pyproject ranges; `uv sync` uses the exact pins. CI
  gains a `locked` job that enforces `uv.lock` with `uv sync --frozen`.
- Moved `ROADMAP.md` → `docs/ROADMAP.md` (kept as development history); README now
  points at `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` as the entry point for how Peaky works.
- Repository URL → `github.com/karsa-oy/peaky` (the public home).

### Fixed
- **Reproducibility: content is a pure function of inputs; only the report timestamp
  varies.** `pipeline.stamp_source_date_epoch()` pins `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` to a FIXED
  content epoch (`CONTENT_EPOCH`, 1980-01-01Z), so matplotlib PNG/PDF metadata and the
  openpyxl xlsx timestamps are constant — every figure's pixels, `merged_ledger.csv`,
  the per-file/cluster csv, and the xlsx tables are byte-identical for identical input
  data, **regardless of when the run happens**. Run time reaches output ONLY as visible
  PDF-cover text (the "generated" line + Report ID), the run-folder name, and
  `run_manifest.json`. The assignment xlsx's run-time "generated" cell was removed (it
  was the only run-time leak into a data file), and `write_excel` is now post-processed
  for byte-stability too. `test_determinism.py` asserts the contract: two runs at
  different times over the same inputs → identical figure/xlsx/csv bytes, with the PDF
  differing only by its visible cover timestamp.
- **`run_batch` now runs the FULL pipeline.** `peaky.run_batch` pointed at the
  assign-only `assign_batch.run` (no figures/report); it now maps to
  `pipeline.run_batch` (assign → cluster → Van Krevelen → report). `run_assign_batch`
  exposes the assign+merge half; `run_pipeline` aliases `run_batch`.
- `run_manifest.json` stores the input time-series path relative to the run dir (or
  absolute when referenced externally) instead of a bare basename, so it stays
  reproducible when the input TS is referenced rather than copied.
- Documented `cleanup.reclaim_envelope_tails` as a known no-op on real data (the leak it
  targets is absorbed upstream); kept but no longer implicitly trusted.

### Changed (outputs)
- **Run folders are organized into subdirectories.** A new `paths.RunPaths` is the single
  source of truth for the layout, shared by the writers and the report reader so their
  filename contract can't drift: `.png` → `figures/`, `.csv`/`.xlsx` → `tables/`, the PDF
  → `report/`. `merged_ledger.csv`, `run_manifest.json`, `batch_summary.json`, and
  `per_file/` stay at the run root (read by several modules + the cross-run registry).
- **The input time-series is no longer copied into every run.** A parquet passed by path
  is referenced in place; only a live-fetched series is persisted once, to `data/`. This
  removes a ~40 MB duplicate per run.
