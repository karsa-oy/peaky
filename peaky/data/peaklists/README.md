# Reference peaklists

A curated catalog of **known-molecule formula lists** from published chemical
systems (oxidation HOM, contaminant families, …). Peaky uses them as a **soft,
context-gated prior** to:

1. **corroborate** Candidate-tier assignments whose neutral formula appears on a
   list for the sample's chemistry, and
2. **rescue / annotate** unexplained peaks — by mass, under the run's reagent
   adducts — so a reader can see *"this unexplained 311.05 matches a known
   monoterpene-HOM, C10H16O7, at −0.3 ppm"*.

This is **not** the Pass-0 known-species lock (`passes._known_species`, for
contaminants the grid cannot reach). It is a post-hoc prior: it never overrides
an isotope-scored **Assigned**, never fabricates, and every match carries the
source list id for provenance.

## Adding a list

Drop in one self-describing JSON here. Nothing else couples — `reflists.load_catalog()`
globs this directory. **Only add credible, citable sources**, and fill `references`.

## Schema (`schema_version: 1`)

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "id": "monoterpene_hom_kang2024",        // unique, file-name-safe
  "system": "monoterpene_OH_oxidation",    // free-text system family
  "label": "Monoterpene OH-oxidation HOM (α-pinene proxy)",
  "data_version": "2024.1",                // bump when the data changes
  "polarity": "negative",                  // native measurement polarity (informational)
  "native_detection": "[M+NO3]-",          // how the SOURCE detected them (informational)
  "applies_to_contexts": ["monoterpene_ox","limonene_ox","ap_ox","biogenic_soa"],
  "references": [                           // REQUIRED — where the formulas come from
    { "authors": "...", "title": "...", "publisher": "...", "year": 2022,
      "isbn": "...", "section": "...", "detection": "...", "note": "..." }
  ],
  "provenance": {                          // how this artifact was produced + caveats
    "extracted_from": "...", "verification": "...", "caveat": "..." },
  "n_species": 830,
  "species": [
    { "formula": "C10H16O7",               // NEUTRAL formula (matchable)
      "conditions": ["pure","NOx"],        // sub-experiments it appeared in (optional)
      "radical": false }                   // odd-H radical HOM -> excluded from default matching
  ]
}
```

### Conventions
- `formula` is always the **neutral** molecule. Lists published as detected ions
  (e.g. `[M+NO3]-` clusters or `[M-H]-`) must be normalized to the neutral on import.
- `radical: true` marks odd-electron / odd-H species (RO•, RO2•). These are excluded
  from default matching (the pipeline assigns closed-shell neutrals); enable with
  `include_radicals=True` if a run targets radical chemistry.
- Masses are **not** stored — they are recomputed (`chemistry.ion_mz`) for whatever
  reagent adduct the run uses, so one list serves Br⁻ / NO3⁻ / I⁻ / urea⁺ runs alike.
