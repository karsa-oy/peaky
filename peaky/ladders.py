"""Pass 6 -- anchored homolog / oxidation-ladder gap-fill.

Diagonal families in the residual (the rotating-GKA view) are homologous /
functionalisation SERIES: a committed analyte and its neighbours related by an
exact repeat unit -- +O oxidation, +/-CH2 / +C2H4 carbon homology, +CO / +CO2 /
+CH2O functionalisation, -H2O dehydration. This pass walks those ladders OUT
from committed anchors and fills the gaps primary matching missed, validated by
Mascope and gated hard against the false positives the adversarial diagonal
analysis surfaced (2026-06-12):

  G1 same adduct along a ladder -- mixed [M-H]- nitrate -> [M+HBr+Br]- di-bromide
     ladders were the dominant false positive at the non-integer GKA rotation;
  G2 valid neighbour chemistry -- integer DBE>=0, structural O cap; +/-CH2 and
     +C2H4 conserve DBE by construction (true homologs);
  G3 the target peak is bright and currently UNEXPLAINED (or a weak Candidate);
  G4 isotope-satellite guard -- 81Br (+1.99795) / 13C (+1.00336) lines of a
     brighter peak masquerade as ladder members; reject them;
  G5 never overwrite a strong competing M0 (ion_score >= 0.90) -- the di-bromide
     reading of a peak already owned by a confident fluorinated/other M0 is kept
     only as a flagged alternative;
  G6 Mascope confirms the proposed neutral under its adduct (score >= tau_good
     in calibrated terms); accept up to ppm_max on the strength of ladder
     membership (this is a completion pass, so it carries pattern evidence the
     bare mass gate lacks);
  G7 Candidate tier only, confidence inherited+capped from the anchor.

[M+HBr+Br]- / [M+HBr+Br2]- have no native server mechanism, so they are scored
through their covalent-equivalent ion (neutral + H2Br2 / H2Br3 as [M-H]-), the
SAME ion -- exactly the alias the reagent-Br policy trades on.
