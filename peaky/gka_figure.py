"""Static Generalized Kendrick Analysis (GKA) figure -- the print counterpart of
the interactive rotating-GKA widget (`scripts/gka_widget.py`).

The widget lets you rotate the Kendrick base live; for the PDF report we freeze
the canonical **CH2** base into a publishable Kendrick mass-defect (KMD) plot and
call out the longest confirmed homologous series. A CH2 addition leaves both the
KMD and the DBE unchanged, so a CH2 homologous series is a HORIZONTAL row of
constant colour -- the rows you see ARE the GKA finding. A second compact panel
summarises the strongest series found under every repeat unit (the structure the
other rotations of the widget would reveal: oxidation, alkoxylate, contaminants).

`detect_series` is a pure data function (no plotting); `render_gka` lazily imports
matplotlib and writes a standalone PNG. Built from one committed ledger -- the
merged batch ledger or a single-file ledger both work (it reads neutral_formula
+ tier only).
