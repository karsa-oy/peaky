    server-anchored bases, so those congeners never reach the ³⁷Cl confirmation
    and are left unexplained -- exactly the "too low score on the server" miss.

    Re-anchor against the LEDGER by exact mass (the server's theoretical M0 mz)
    and commit ONLY when BOTH hold:

      * a real, still-unexplained ledger peak sits within ``anchor_tol`` ppm of
        the theoretical M0 mass (offset-aware, like the main loop), AND
