"""Post-assignment residual cleanup (single-file, runs after pass 6).

Three honest reclassifications of the leftover 'unexplained' residual, none of
which invent chemistry the spectrum doesn't support:

  1. flag_ringing_artifacts -- a weak peak sitting within a few mDa of a MUCH
     brighter peak is a peak-shape / ringing / shoulder artifact of that bright
     ion, not a real ion. Role -> 'artifact'.

  2. label_bromide_clusters -- a strongly negative mass-defect peak (defect <
     -0.16 => >=2 reagent Br) that carries a Br isotope partner and has no sane
     covalent reading is a bromide reagent-cluster ion. Role -> 'reagent'.

  3. recover_isotope_gated -- the genuine molecules the score gate dropped:
     enumerate ONLY low-complexity CHO/CHON/CHOS (+<=1 covalent Br/Cl), and
     commit a winner ONLY when the measured halogen isotope pattern CONFIRMS the
     candidate's halogen count (an independent corroboration that justifies the
     relaxed score floor). The halogen-isotope requirement + complexity clamp is
     what keeps the N2S2 / O-monster mass-fit flood out.

    channel for the labelled profile, to avoid an uncontrolled exact-isobar
    competitor), so every ¹⁴NO₃ cluster is mislabeled as a covalent organonitrate.

    """Uronium / positive urea-CIMS: a [M+NH4]+ adduct of a CHO neutral X is mass-
    AND isotope-identical to [M+H]+ of the amine X+NH3 (the SAME ion formula), so
    the accurate mass + isotope pattern CANNOT distinguish an ammonium adduct of X
    from a protonated amine X+NH3. The one discriminator is TIME: a true ammonium
    adduct of X must track X's own [M+H]+/urea parent trace, because it is the same
    molecule ionised two ways.

    POLICY -- ammonium adducts are rare, so the burden of proof is on the ADDUCT
    reading; the protonated CHON wins by default. Per [M+NH4]+-mass neutral X, with a
    batch time series (2 h-binned log-correlation r of the [M+NH4]+ trace vs the best
    of X's [M+H]+ / [M+(CH4N2O)H]+ parent traces):

      * KEEP as [M+NH4]+ adduct (Assigned) ONLY when it TRACKS a shaped parent
        (r >= r_min, overlap >= min_overlap) -- confirmed same molecule.
      * OTHERWISE default to [M+H]+ of the protonated CHON (amine X+NH3), at
        Candidate tier: independent time trace (r <= r_reject), only weak tracking
        (r_reject<r<r_min), a flat unconfirmable parent, or a parent absent from the
        TS. We do NOT assert an ammonium adduct we cannot confirm.

    Overriding exceptions (keep [M+NH4]+):
      * X contains Si: ammonium adducts of siloxanes are real contaminant chemistry;
        the +NH3 re-read would fabricate an "aminosiloxane". (Tier unchanged.)
      * X is PROTECTED -- identity established by curation/cross-channel evidence
        independent of the NH4 channel (reflist-rescue / known-species / certified
        provenance; pass the neutral-formula set as `protected`). Holds e.g. NBBS.
        (Tier unchanged.)
      * the amine X+NH3 is valence-impossible (saturated X -> negative DBE): the
        ammonium reading is the only valid one, kept but capped Candidate.

    Without a time series (single-sample run) nothing can be confirmed, so every
    non-Si/protected [M+NH4]+ defaults to the protonated CHON (Candidate).

    A re-read changes neutral_formula + adduct and caps the tier at Candidate (the
    ion/m-z/score/ppm are identical). Mutates in place; returns a summary."""
