"""The peak ledger -- the single mutable state carrier for the whole pipeline.

One ledger row == one PHYSICAL peak (deduplicated by peak_id). Passes fill and
annotate rows; they never drop them. Every committed assignment carries
provenance + commentary, and the commit API enforces the structural invariants
so no pass can corrupt the shared state:

  I1. Each peak has exactly one role: 'unexplained' | 'M0' | 'iso_child'
      | 'reagent' | 'artifact' | 'fragment'.
  I2. An 'iso_child' row points (parent_peak_id) to a peak that owns an M0
      assignment.
  I3. A peak that is already locked is immutable to later passes.
  I4. No peak is claimed twice (an iso_child cannot also be an M0 owner).
  I5. Every M0 / series / contaminant assignment records pass + method +
      confidence + commentary.

This module is pure pandas; it never talks to Mascope.
