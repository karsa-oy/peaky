"""Representative-sample selection for batch assignment — THE RULE.

A single averaged / single-file spectrum misses peaks that are only present at
certain times: `assign.run` scores ONE sample, so an analyte that spikes during
an event window is never in the candidate list when the chosen file predates the
spike. This bit us on the uronium 24-h run — the 08:20 snapshot sat at hour 11.3,
BEFORE the hour 18-22 event, so the event-only analytes (C10H19NO2, C9H14O2, ...)
were invisible until event files were assigned and merged.

THE RULE (agent-peaky, set 2026-06-19): to get a peak list representative of the
WHOLE batch, assign a small fixed subset and merge it, where the subset is

  * N_TIME (=5) samples evenly spaced across the batch's TIME range — catches
    peaks that appear / disappear over the run; the time endpoints are always
    included, so the start and end of the experiment are covered; PLUS
  * the single MAX-TIC sample — the richest spectrum, the most peaks above the
    detection floor in one shot.

Selecting in TIME (not by row index) matters: an irregularly-sampled run (dense
early, a lone late file, or a gap) must still place a pick on the sparse late
region. The downstream merge (by m/z) of the per-sample assignments is the
representative peak matrix.

Pure pandas/numpy; no network. The selected `sample_item_id`s feed `assign.run`
one at a time (match_compounds is per-sample), then the ledgers are merged.

# Strategy 2: BRIGHTEST-COVERAGE (the "bin-then-assign" realization).
#
# THE RULE picks samples by TIME; but match_compounds can only commit a peak in a
# sample where that peak's isotope envelope is actually present, i.e. where it is
# bright. On a reagent-CIMS run the max-TIC pick is dominated by the (huge) reagent
# ion, so it is the brightest sample for only a small fraction of ANALYTE peaks
# (measured: 13% on the orange Br- batch) and event-only analytes stay unexplained.
#
# Brightest-coverage instead bins ALL batch peaks by m/z (timeseries.build_matrix),
# and for each significant bin takes the sample where it is BRIGHTEST. Because each
# bin has exactly one brightest (arg-max) sample, the winner sets are DISJOINT, so
# the optimal cover is simply: take winner samples in descending bins-won order
# until `coverage_target` of significant bins is covered (capped at k_max, floored
# at k_min). The selected ids feed the SAME assign.run + merge as THE RULE — only
# WHICH real samples get assigned changes, never the scoring or the merge. It is a
# COVERAGE play (catches more analyte peaks), not a speed play (~k_max assigns).
