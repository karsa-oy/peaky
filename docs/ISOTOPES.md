# Peaky — Isotopes (pattern prediction + prescan → grid constraints)

This document explains **two number transforms keyed off isotope masses**: (a)
predicting an ion's isotopologue envelope `[(Δm, rel-intensity, label)]`, and (b)
the *prescan* that reads satellite pairs off the raw peak list to **shrink the
formula grid before any scoring call**. It is a module deep-dive companion to
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) (the whole pipeline),
[`CHEMISTRY.md`](CHEMISTRY.md) (the grid this constrains), and
[`SCORING.md`](SCORING.md) (the authoritative isotope *judge* — this module is
**not** a scorer).

**Code:** `peaky/chem/isotopes.py`. The prescan answers two cheap questions —
*which heteroatoms show isotope-pair evidence?* and *how large is C?* — so the
candidate search shrinks before the server/local scorer is ever called.

> Keep this in sync with the code. Every threshold below is a named constant or a
> literal in `isotopes.py`; if you change one there, change it here.

## 1. What this stage does

Two related jobs, both pure arithmetic on isotope masses + natural abundances:

- **`isotope_pattern(ion_formula)`** — convolve each element's per-atom isotope
  distribution into the ion's resolved M+1/M+2/M+4 envelope. This is what lets the
  envelope-completion pass recognize an unexplained peak as a committed parent's
  satellite.
- **`prescan(peaks)` → `constrain_ranges`** — walk the brightest peaks for
  characteristic satellite pairs (¹³C, ⁸¹Br, ³⁷Cl, ³⁴S, ²⁹Si) at known Δm with
  *plausible intensity ratios*, then **cap C** and **zero out heteroatoms with no
  spectral evidence** in the grid box — a large combinatorial saving, gated by what
  the context allows.

## 2. Inputs

- **`prescan`** — a peak table (`mz`, `height`); optional `reagent_mzs` to strip
  known reagent clusters first so bare Brₙ doesn't masquerade as analyte Br.
- **`constrain_ranges`** — the base grid box, a `PrescanResult`, and
  `context_caps` (per-element max the reagent context permits).
- **`isotope_pattern`** — an **ion** formula string.

---

## 3. The transformation, stage by stage

### Prescan (grid-shrinking)

1. **Strip reagent peaks.** Drop any peak within **`reagent_ppm` (15)** of a known
   reagent-cluster m/z, then sort by height (the brightest peaks carry the isotope
   information) and scan the top **`n_scan` = min(N, 400)**.

2. **¹³C → carbon count.** Probe `parent + D_13C (1.003355)` within
   **`ppm_tol` (8)**. If the satellite/parent ratio is in **[0.003, 0.9]**,
   estimate `n_C = round(ratio / R_13C_PER_C)` with `R_13C_PER_C = 0.0107` (1.1 %
   per carbon); keep the running max.

3. **⁸¹Br.** Probe `parent + D_81BR (1.9979521)`. Ratio in **[0.6, 1.4]** → a
   single Br (`81Br/79Br ≈ 0.97`). Ratio in **[1.5, 2.6]** → check the M+4 at
   `parent + 2·D_81BR` is **[0.6, 1.4]** → Br₂ (`has_multi_Br`).

4. **³⁷Cl.** `parent + D_37CL (1.997050)`, ratio in **[0.22, 0.45]** (one Cl,
   `37Cl/35Cl ≈ 0.32`) → `has_Cl`.

5. **³⁴S.** `parent + D_34S (1.995796)`, ratio in **[0.025, 0.09]** (per S,
   `34S/32S ≈ 0.044`) → `has_S`.

6. **²⁹Si.** `parent + D_29SI (0.999568)`, ratio in **[0.035, 0.08]** (per Si,
   `29Si/28Si ≈ 0.051`) → `has_Si`.

7. **Constrain the grid** (`constrain_ranges`). Cap C at
   **`estimated_max_C + 4`** (headroom) when estimated; for each of Br/Cl/S/Si,
   set the range to `(0, 0)` when there is **no evidence** *or* the context cap is
   ≤ 0, else clamp to the context cap.

### Pattern prediction

8. **Convolve** (`isotope_pattern`). Build the distribution as the per-atom
   convolution of `_ISO_DIST` (each element's `[(Δm_from_lightest, abundance)]`),
   keyed on the mass shift rounded to mDa. Prune paths below **`PRUNE` 1e-6** — soft
   enough that multi-atom cross terms survive (a 4-Si M+4 is a sum of many ~1e-3
   paths; an aggressive prune underpredicts it and a silanediol M+4 wrongly
   survives as a contaminant).

9. **Merge + threshold.** Keep lines with `0.4 < Δm ≤ max_shift (6.5)`; merge any
   two closer than **`merge_da` (0.006)** (the picker resolves them as one peak, so
   ⁸¹Br at +1.9978 and ³⁰Si at +1.9968 *add*); emit `(Δm, rel, label)` for every
   line with `rel ≥ min_rel (0.03)`. `_label_for_shift` names the dominant
   achievable isotopologue (restricted to combos the formula can form — a 1-Br
   ion's M+4 is `81Br+30Si`, never `81Br2`) when within **0.012 Da**, else `M+N`.

## 5. Metrics, defined

- **satellite ratio** — `height(parent+Δm) / height(parent)`; compared to a
  per-element acceptance window, **not** scored. Outside the window → no evidence.
- **`estimated_max_C`** — `round(¹³C-ratio / 0.0107)`, the running max over scanned
  parents; the carbon ceiling fed to the grid.
- **`rel` (envelope)** — line intensity ÷ M0 intensity, after convolution + merge.
- **`Δm`** — intensity-weighted exact mass shift of a (possibly merged) envelope
  line.

| artifact | content |
| --- | --- |
| `PrescanResult` | `has_Br/has_Cl/has_S/has_Si`, `has_multi_Br`, `estimated_max_C`, `evidence[]` (the hits); `as_dict()` for the manifest |
| `constrain_ranges` | a tightened grid box (C capped, unsupported heteroatoms zeroed, context-clamped) |
| `isotope_pattern` | `[(Δm, rel_intensity, label)]` sorted by shift, lines ≥ `min_rel` |

---

## 7. Properties, invariants & gotchas

- **The prescan is NOT a scorer.** It only proposes which heteroatoms/Cmax to *let
  into the grid*; Mascope's maths (local or server) is the authoritative isotope
  judge ([`SCORING.md`](SCORING.md)). A ratio outside a window means "don't widen
  the grid", never "reject the formula".
- **Evidence-gated heteroatoms.** With no ⁸¹Br/³⁷Cl/³⁴S/²⁹Si pair, that element is
  forced to `(0,0)` — the combinatorial saving and the reason a neutral halogen
  must *earn* its place.
- **Context still bounds it.** `constrain_ranges` clamps to `context_caps`; a
  context that allows 0 of an element zeroes it regardless of a stray pair.
- **The prune is intentionally soft (1e-6).** Multi-atom M+4 cross terms are sums
  of many tiny paths; pruning hard underpredicts the M+4 and lets a silanediol M+4
  masquerade as a Cl doublet.
- **Merged lines add.** Two isotopologues closer than 6 mDa are reported as one
  line at their intensity-weighted mass, mirroring what the peak picker resolves.
- **Labels are formula-aware.** `_label_for_shift` only names combinations the
  formula can form, so a 1-Br ion never gets an `81Br2` label.
- **`D_81BR` was corrected** to 1.9979521 (AME2020) to stay consistent with the
  doublet constant the residual pass uses — a stale 0.16 mDa-low value broke that
  agreement.
