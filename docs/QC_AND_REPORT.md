# Peaky — QC figure & PDF report assembly

This document explains **two reporting transforms**: the two-panel mass-defect /
mass-error QC figure (numbers read straight off a full ledger), and how the
iterable A4 PDF is assembled from a run's on-disk artifacts — including the
*honest "explained"* signal-share accounting. It is a module deep-dive companion
to [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) (the whole pipeline, §7–8),
[`OUTPUTS.md`](OUTPUTS.md) (every artifact the report reads), and
[`ASSIGNMENT.md`](ASSIGNMENT.md) (the tiers it visualises).

**Code:** `peaky/reporting/qc_figure.py` (the QC figure) and
`peaky/reporting/pdf_report.py` (the report spine: `load_context` → `SECTIONS` →
`build`). Both are pure functions of their inputs; matplotlib stamps the fixed
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, so the primary report is byte-deterministic.

> Keep this in sync with the code. Every threshold below is a named constant or a
> literal in `qc_figure.py` / `pdf_report.py`; if you change one there, change it
> here.

## 1. What this stage does

- **QC figure** — from one **full per-sample ledger** (every role, including
  iso-children and the unexplained residual), draw (a) a **mass-defect map** split
  into five tier/role categories and (b) a **ppm mass-error vs m/z** plot of the
  Assigned + Candidate M0 rows with a fitted **calibration-drift trend**.
- **PDF report** — load the run's artifacts once into a `ctx` dict (the only place
  numbers are derived), then draw an ordered list of `SECTIONS`, each a
  `section(ctx, pdf)` function. The genuine accounting transform here is the
  **role signal share** that keeps "98 % explained" from masquerading as "98 %
  analyte characterised".

## 2. Inputs

- **QC figure** — a FULL per-sample ledger (all roles). The report passes the
  **brightest** representative ledger (`ctx["bright_ledger"]`, max total height).
- **PDF** — `out_dir` (the run folder): `merged_ledger.csv`, `per_file/*_ledger.csv`,
  `tables/selected_samples.csv`, the `figures/`, and the `*_summary.json` files.
  `batch_name`, `run_id`, `generated` text are passed in.

---

## 3. The transformation, stage by stage

### A. The QC figure (`qc_figure.py`)

1. **Mass defect** (`mass_defect`). `md = mz − round(mz)` ∈ [−0.5, 0.5).

2. **Split categories** (`split_categories`). A full ledger → five panel-(a) sets:
   the grey **`unexplained`** cloud, **Assigned·M0** / **Candidate·M0** (split by
   the M0 row's tier), and **Assigned·iso-child** / **Candidate·iso-child** (each
   iso-child inherits its **parent's** tier via `parent_peak_id`). Rows whose tier
   is neither Assigned nor Candidate are dropped from the coloured sets (the
   unexplained cloud is unaffected). `_norm_tier` tolerates the legacy `Identified`
   spelling.

3. **ppm points** (`ppm_points`). Assigned + Candidate M0 rows carrying a finite
   `ppm_error` → panel (b).

4. **Render + trend** (`render_qc`). Panel (a) draws the categories in `CATEGORIES`
   order (grey cloud underneath, `zorder` 1; coloured assignments on top). Panel
   (b) plots ppm vs m/z with a 0-line and, when ≥ 2 points span m/z, a
   `np.polyfit` degree-1 **linear trend** — the annotation reports
   `slope·1000` **mppm/Th**, the intercept (ppm), and the median. A sloped/offset
   trend is the calibration-drift read the tier engine self-calibrates from.

### B. The PDF report (`pdf_report.py`)

5. **Load context once** (`load_context`). Read the artifacts and derive every
   number a section needs: `n_m0`, `tiers`, `n_neutrals`, **`composition`** (by
   CHO/CHON/CHOS backbone), `hetero` side-counts (Si/F/Cl-Br bearing),
   `score_by_tier`, `adduct_counts`, the representative `samples`, pooled
   `role_count`, the **`bright_ledger`** (max-height full ledger → the QC figure),
   `role_signal`, **`role_signal_frac`**, `neutral_signal`, `expl_mz`,
   `iso_by_channel`, `ppm_by_cat`, `adduct_signal`, and the reference-list priors.

6. **Honest "explained" share** (`role_signal_frac`). Split total signal into
   `analyte = (M0 + iso_child)/total`, `reagent = reagent/total`,
   `unexplained = (unexplained + artifact)/total`. A Br⁻ spectrum is mostly the
   reagent ion, so the coverage headline reports analyte share separately —
   "explained" by count is *not* "analyte characterised" by signal.

7. **Draw the sections** (`SECTIONS`, `build`). 13 ordered sections (cover →
   `assignments_table`). `build` iterates them into a `PdfPages`; a section that
   throws is caught and rendered as a one-page error note — **one bad section never
   kills the report**. The `qc_massdefect` section calls `render_qc` on
   `bright_ledger`; the `gka` section embeds `gka_<tag>.png`. Figures embed via
   `_image_page` (fit-to-A4 at `dpi` 200, or `native=True` → page = image size at
   `src_dpi` 170 for tall cluster panels).

8. **Optional compressed companion** (`compress_pdf`). Downsample each embedded
   raster to `max_px` (850) on its long edge, re-encode JPEG at `quality` 58 (text
   stays vector); skipped if the input is under `min_mb` (2.0) or PyMuPDF/Pillow
   aren't installed. Deliberately **outside `build`** so the primary report stays
   byte-for-byte deterministic.

## 4. Constants reference

`qc_figure.py` + `pdf_report.py`.

| constant | value | role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CATEGORIES` | 5 tier/role tuples | panel-(a) sets, colours, markers, draw order (grey cloud `zorder` 1) |
| `PPM_TIER_COLORS` | Assigned / Candidate | panel-(b) colours |
| `mass_defect` range | [−0.5, 0.5) | `mz − round(mz)` |
| `A4` | (8.27, 11.69) in | portrait page size |
| `SECTIONS` | 13 functions | the ordered report spine (cover…assignments_table) |
| `_image_page` `dpi` / `src_dpi` | 200 / 170 | fit-to-A4 raster dpi / native page-size dpi |
| `_ISO_C13` | 1.0033548 | ¹³C−¹²C, to recover an isotopologue's mass error |
| `compress_pdf` `max_px` | 850 | long-edge pixel cap when downsampling figures |
| `compress_pdf` `quality` | 58 | JPEG quality of the compressed companion |
| `compress_pdf` `min_mb` | 2.0 | skip compression below this input size |

## 5. Metrics, defined

- **mass defect** — `mz − round(mz)`; the y-axis of panel (a). Assigned points
  trace the CH/CHO band; the grey cloud shows where unexplained signal sits.
- **ppm trend** — degree-1 `polyfit` of `ppm_error` vs `mz`: `slope` (reported as
  mppm/Th), `intercept` (ppm at m/z 0), and the `median` ppm; the calibration-drift
  diagnostic.
- **`role_signal_frac`** — signal share split analyte / reagent / unexplained; the
  honest coverage number behind the headline.
- **`composition`** — neutral counts by CHO/CHON/CHOS backbone (Si/F/halogen folded
  in, via `analyte_viz.backbone_class`).
- **`score_by_tier` / `adduct_signal`** — mean `ion_score` per tier; signal share
  per ion channel.

## 6. Outputs

| artifact | content |
| --- | --- |
| `figures/qc_<tag>.png` (via `qc_massdefect`) | two-panel mass-defect + ppm-error QC figure |
| `figures/gka_<tag>.png` | the GKA findings page ([`GKA.md`](GKA.md)) embedded by the `gka` section |
| `report/report_<run-id>.pdf` | the standard iterable A4 report (13 sections) |
| `report/report_<run-id>_compressed.pdf` | optional size-reduced companion (full report untouched) |

---

## 7. Properties, invariants & gotchas

- **The QC figure reads the FULL ledger, the GKA figure the MERGED (M0-only) one.**
  QC shows the whole spectrum at once (iso-children + the unexplained cloud); GKA
  shows only committed neutrals.
- **iso-children inherit the parent's tier** — the tier lives only on M0 rows, so a
  satellite is coloured by the M0 it points at.
- **The report is iterable by design.** Add/reorder a `section(ctx, pdf)` and list
  it in `SECTIONS`; nothing else couples. `ctx` is loaded once and sections degrade
  gracefully when an artifact is missing.
- **One bad section is non-fatal** — it becomes an error page, so a partial run
  still yields a report.
- **Honest coverage.** Count-coverage and signal-coverage differ sharply on
  reagent-CIMS; `role_signal_frac` is why the report never conflates "explained"
  with "analyte characterised".
- **Determinism.** Both figures and the primary PDF are pure functions of the
  inputs with a fixed content epoch, so a re-run is byte-identical; `compress_pdf`
  is kept out of `build` to preserve that (see
  [`ARCHITECTURE.md §7`](ARCHITECTURE.md#7-reproducibility--provenance)).
- **Compression is best-effort** — no optional deps, or an under-`min_mb` input, is
  a silent no-op that never touches the full report.
